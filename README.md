Welcome to the NextJS base template bootstrapped using the create-next-app. This template supports TypeScript, but you can use normal JavaScript as well.

Getting Started
Hit the run button to start the development server.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on /api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

Productionizing your Next App
To make your next App run smoothly in production make sure to turn this repl to an always-on repl.

You can also produce a production build by running npm run build and changing the run command to npm run start.
